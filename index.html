        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <img src="/images/selfiewdog.JPG" id="selfie">
        <p>My name is Mr. Montoya and I created this page to share my tips and shortcuts in mathematics. 
            As a first-generation Latino college graduate studying mathematics I was able to witness the difference in high school math preparation amongst myself and peers. I dedicated my graduate studies to mastering
            the content much better than I did my first go around in undergrad. Some of these tips are based off patterns I noticed
            or were pointed out. Please take note of them and practice a good amount of problems so that you can notice patterns 
            and shortcuts of your own.

        <h2>Precalculus</h2>
        <img src="/images/mathquote.JPG">
        <p>Precalculus begins with a refresher of college algebra topics like: linear equations, absolute values,
            distance, area applications, quadratics, functions, transformations of functions. It then moves on 
            to topics like: composition of functions, inverses, polynomials, rational functions, exponents, 
            logarithms, systems of equations, sequences, series, limits, trigonometry, trigonometric formulas, and applications of trigonometry.

        <h2>Calculus 1</h2>
        <img src="/images/calcbook.jpg">
        <p>Calculus 1 starts off by review of precalculus topics you should recall in preparation for this course. 
            For example: library of functions, transformations, and limits. Then it starts to move into: limit laws, continuity, derivatives, derivative rules and applications, 
            inverses of most functions, applications of differentiation, and parametric/polar equations.

        <h2>Calculus 2</h2>
        <img src="/images/studymath.png" id="studying">
        <p>While calculus 1 revolves around derivatives, Calculus 2 revolves around antiderivatives aka integrals. Topics include: Riemman sums, integration rules,
            integration techniques, sequences, series, convergence tests. Though this list is shorter than the other sections, each topic listed
            unpacks with various subsections.
