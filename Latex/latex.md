## Real Line

### Types of Numbers
The number line consists of all real numbers ($\mathbf{R}$), which can be broken down into four groups. 

1. Natural Numbers ($\mathbf{N}$): aka the counting numbers are $1, 2, 3, 4, .....,\infty$
1. Integers($\mathbf{Z}$): includes the natural's ($\mathbf{N}$), their negative counterparts, and zero: $-\infty,...,-2, -1, 0, 1, 2, ...,\infty$
1. Rationals ($\mathbf{Q}$): are numbers that can be expressed as a quotient of two integers, where the denominator is not equal to zero, in other words: $\frac{p}{q}$ where $p,q\in\mathbf{Z}$ and $q\neq 0$. Rationals emcompass the integers ($\mathbf{Z}$) and thus the naturals ($\mathbf{N}$) as well. ex: $\frac{1}{2}, -35, \frac{17}{30}, 2.75,$ etc. are $\mathbf{Q}$'s.
1. Irrationals: these are numbers that cannot be expressed as a rational. Examples can be like non-repeating decimals (like $\pi$ or $e$) or square roots of non-perfect squares (like $\sqrt{2}, \sqrt{15},$ etc.)

### Arithmetic Laws
With the above group of numbers we have the following laws: (assume $a,b,c\in\mathbf{R}$)

**Commutativity**

* *of addition*: you can add numbers in any order $a+b=b+a$

* *of multiplication*: you can multiply numbers in any order $ab=ba$

**Associativity**

* *of addition*: grouping doesn't matter in addition $(a+b)+c=a+(b+c)$

* *of multiplication*: grouping doesn't matter in multiplication $(ab)c=a(bc)$

#### Recall PEMDAS
Always respect the order of operations, following the acronym as **Parenthesis, Exponent, Multiplication or Division, Add or Subtract**. Notice MD and AS have an "or", this is because you must do whichever one comes first from left to right. 
For example:

$9\div 3(2)-4+3$

If done *incorrectly* you might do something like 

$9\div 3(2)-4+3$\
$=9\div 6-1$\
$=1.5-1=0.5$

But when following order from left to right you get the *correct* answer of: 

$9\div 3(2)-4+3$ \
$=3(2)-4+3$    (dividing the 9 by 3) \
$=6-4+3$\
$=2+3=5$
